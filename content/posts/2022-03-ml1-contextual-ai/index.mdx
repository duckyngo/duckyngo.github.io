Currently, We are building a chatbot that can chat and confide in humans like a real friend. One of problems with existing chatbots is that they cannot remember previous conversations. Therefore, it is very difficult for them to become a true friend, they have no empathy for us and just act like a bot. While researching, I found an approach called contextual AI that may solve problems.

Contextual AI will help a traditional AI system, chat box and virtual assistant can act like a real human.  Without contextual understanding, data is just reduced to random information. 

By leveraging contextual AI to Chatbot, voice assistantâ€¦ , a virtual assistant can recall historical data, user inputs, previous interactions. It will make the AI system smarter, smoother and more user-friendly
