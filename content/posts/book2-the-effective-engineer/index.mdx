Authors: An ex-googler, who help to create the Google Maps service. Then, he left Google and create FriendFeed.

The book covers one useful framework, called leverage, for analyzing the effectiveness of different activities. 
**leverage activity**
Engineering is much more about leverage than just programming ability.
Not correlated with hours of effort “nine-to-five” culture.

Work smart > Work hard


## Introduction:
The book start with some questions from author when he was working on his startup: 
1. Is putting 70 to 80 hour weeks really the most effective way of ensuring one startup’s success?
2. Could we work smarter and reduce some of effort and achieved the same impact or possibly more?

In fact, working for more hours isn’t the most effective way to increate output but they can leads to decreases productivity. To be effective engineers, we need to able to identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments. **Not all work is created equal, well-intentioned translate into impact**.

#### What makes an Effective Engineer?
It’s not measured by how many hours, amount of effort, or number of  tasks… At the end of the day, hard working engineer release a feature which they’ve putting so many hours but no one use, it’s not effective

**Work less and accomplish more**
The effective engineer, they are the people who **let things done**, ship product that **users love**, launch feature that **customers pay for**, build tools that **boost team productivity**, and deploy systems that help companies scale … **IN A REASONABLE OF TIME**

Effective engineers focus on **value and impact**, they know how to choose which results to deliver.


The book is organized into three parts. 
Part 1: mindsets that allow us to reason more rigorously about and increase our effectiveness. 
1. Leverage - Chapter 1
2. Optimizing for learning 
3. Regular prioritization 
4. Iterating quickly
5. Validating ideas
6. Measurement 
7. Estimation skills 
8. Balance between quality and pragmatism
9. Minimize burden
10. Invest in team’s growth 




# Part 1: Adopt the Right Mindsets
