## **The Basics of On-Camera Flash**  

Flash photography is often misunderstood, with many assuming that an external flash unit will always create artificial-looking images. However, when used correctly, flash can enhance photos by filling in shadows, improving subject clarity, and maintaining exposure balance.  

### **Key Flash Settings**  

- **TTL (Through-The-Lens) vs. Manual Mode**: TTL adjusts flash power automatically based on camera metering, while manual mode allows full control over flash intensity.  
- **Flash Exposure Compensation (FEC)**: Adjusting FEC helps fine-tune the brightness of the flash output.  
- **Shutter Speed, Aperture, and ISO**: Understanding the relationship between these settings ensures proper exposure when combining flash and ambient light.  

---  
## **Bounce Flash: Creating Soft, Natural Light**  

One of Niekerk‚Äôs core techniques is **bounce flash**, which redirects light off ceilings, walls, or other surfaces to create a softer, more natural look. Instead of aiming the flash directly at the subject, photographers can use their surroundings to diffuse and spread light.  

### **Techniques for Effective Bounce Flash**  

1. **Use White or Neutral Surfaces**: Colored walls or ceilings can create unwanted color casts.  
2. **Control the Direction**: Angling the flash toward a side wall rather than the ceiling can create more natural directional lighting.  
3. **Use a Bounce Card**: When no suitable surfaces are available, a bounce card helps diffuse the light.  

### **Benefits of Bounce Flash**  

- Eliminates harsh shadows and red-eye.  
- Creates a more even, flattering light for portraits.  
- Helps maintain a balance between flash and ambient light.  

---  
## **Balancing Flash with Ambient Light**  

Many photographers struggle with integrating flash into naturally lit environments without making the scene look artificial. Niekerk emphasizes that the goal is to make the flash **blend seamlessly** with available light.  

### **How to Balance Flash and Ambient Light**  

- **Adjust Flash Power**: Reduce flash intensity so it acts as a subtle fill light rather than the dominant light source.  
- **Use a Slow Shutter Speed**: A longer exposure allows ambient light to contribute more to the scene, avoiding the typical "flashed" look.  
- **Modify White Balance**: Adjusting white balance settings ensures that flash and natural light blend without creating color inconsistencies.  

---  
## **Flash Modifiers: Enhancing Light Quality**  

To further refine on-camera flash, Niekerk discusses **flash modifiers**, tools that shape and soften the light output. These can be particularly useful when bouncing flash isn‚Äôt an option.  

### **Popular Flash Modifiers**  

- **Bounce Cards**: Direct some light toward the subject while bouncing the rest for a softer effect.  
- **Diffusers**: Spread light more evenly to reduce harsh shadows.  
- **Softboxes & Gels**: Softboxes mimic natural light, while gels help match flash color to ambient light.  

Using the right modifier depends on the environment and the desired effect. Event photographers often carry a small selection to adapt to different shooting conditions.  

---  
## **Avoiding Common Flash Photography Mistakes**  

Many photographers make errors when using flash, leading to unnatural-looking results. Niekerk highlights common mistakes and how to avoid them:  

1. **Overexposing the Subject**: Use Flash Exposure Compensation (-1 to -2 stops) to prevent an overly bright subject.  
2. **Flat Lighting**: Avoid direct flash and use bounce techniques to create depth.  
3. **Strong Shadows Behind the Subject**: Bounce flash properly or use a fill light to soften shadows.  
4. **Red-Eye Effect**: Position the flash slightly off-axis or use a bounce technique.  
5. **Underexposing Backgrounds**: Adjust camera settings to ensure the background doesn‚Äôt turn completely dark.
