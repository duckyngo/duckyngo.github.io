### *By Peter Hurley (2015)*  

## 📷 Introduction

---

## 🎭 The Power of a Headshot  
A headshot is more than just a photo—it's a representation of a person’s brand, personality, and confidence. Whether for actors, business professionals, or social media profiles, the right headshot can make a significant impact.  

Hurley explains that people are naturally drawn to faces, and a strong headshot can build trust and engagement. He emphasizes that the best portraits capture an *authentic expression* rather than just a posed look.  

---

## 👀 Mastering Expression: The Key to a Great Headshot  
Hurley’s most famous lesson is that *expression* makes or breaks a headshot. Lighting and technical aspects are important, but without a compelling expression, the image falls flat.  

- **Confidence & Approachability**: The subject should appear self-assured yet friendly.  
- **The Squinch**: A subtle narrowing of the eyes that gives the subject a more intense, confident look.  
- **Jawline Definition**: Slight adjustments in posture to create a more flattering, defined jawline.  
- **Micro-Expression Control**: Encouraging small, natural changes in the face to capture authenticity.  

Hurley spends significant time on coaching methods to help subjects relax and project the best version of themselves.  

---

## 💡 Lighting Techniques for Headshots  
Lighting is a critical component of headshot photography. Hurley prefers soft, even lighting that flatters facial features while minimizing harsh shadows.  

### **Key Lighting Principles**:  
- **Soft Light**: Helps eliminate unwanted shadows and creates a clean, polished look.  
- **Flat Lighting**: Ensures even exposure across the subject's face.  
- **Shadow Control**: Adds depth and dimension when necessary, but should be subtle.  
- **Background Lighting**: Should complement, not distract from, the subject.  

Hurley provides diagrams of his preferred lighting setups, which include:  
1. **Clamshell Lighting** – A two-light setup for even illumination.  
2. **Rembrandt Lighting** – A slight shadow under the eye for added dimension.  
3. **Natural Light Techniques** – Using window light effectively for a soft look.  

---

## 🗣 Directing and Coaching the Subject  
A headshot photographer is more than just someone who clicks a shutter; they must act as a director. Hurley outlines techniques for making subjects comfortable, drawing out natural expressions, and building trust.  

### **Coaching Techniques**:  
- **Talking Throughout the Shoot** – Keeps subjects engaged and less self-conscious.  
- **Giving Clear, Simple Directions** – Helps guide their expressions naturally.  
- **Using Humor & Energy** – Lightens the mood and encourages authentic reactions.  
- **Micro-Adjustments** – Small tweaks to posture and facial expression make a big difference.  

---

## 📏 Composition & Framing  
The way a headshot is framed impacts how it is perceived. Hurley discusses:  

- **Head Positioning**: Small angle shifts can enhance the subject's face.  
- **Tight Cropping**: Cutting out distractions to keep the focus on the eyes.  
- **Eye Line Placement**: Aligning the eyes near the upper third of the frame for better balance.  
- **Symmetry & Asymmetry**: Using slight asymmetry for a more dynamic look.  

Hurley encourages photographers to test different compositions to find the most flattering angle for each subject.  

---

## 🎭 Body Language & Posture  
Although headshots focus primarily on the face, body positioning still plays a role. Hurley explains how slight tilts of the head, relaxed shoulders, and avoiding tension in the neck can all contribute to a more natural look.  

Some key tips include:  
- Avoiding *straight-on, stiff poses*  
- Creating a *slight lean forward* for engagement  
- Adjusting the shoulders to add depth to the image  

---

## 🖥 Retouching: Enhancing Without Overdoing It  
Hurley believes in a natural look when it comes to retouching. He shares his approach to enhancing an image while keeping the subject's features realistic.  

### **Retouching Focus Areas**:  
- **Skin Softening** – Reducing blemishes without eliminating texture.  
- **Eye Enhancement** – Brightening the whites while maintaining realism.  
- **Jawline Refinement** – Subtle contouring to enhance structure.  
- **Color & Contrast Adjustments** – Bringing out the best in the subject's skin tones.  

He warns against over-processing, which can make images look unnatural.  

---

## 🎯 Camera Gear & Settings for Headshots  
While Hurley emphasizes that great photography is about skill, not just gear, he does recommend certain tools to achieve the best results.  

### **Recommended Gear**:  
- **Camera**: Full-frame DSLRs or mirrorless cameras with high resolution.  
- **Lenses**: 85mm to 135mm prime lenses for natural perspective and compression.  
- **Aperture**: F/4 to f/8 for sharp focus while maintaining background softness.  
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/125s or higher to avoid motion blur.  
- **ISO**: As low as possible to maintain image quality.  

Hurley stresses that while gear matters, *understanding light, composition, and expression is far more important*.  

---

## 🎨 Developing Your Own Headshot Style  
Rather than just copying his techniques, Hurley encourages photographers to develop their own artistic vision. He suggests:  

- Experimenting with different lighting and angles  
- Practicing expression coaching techniques  
- Studying how body language affects the perception of a subject  
- Creating a signature look that differentiates your work  

---

# **📸 The Headshot: The Secrets to Creating Amazing Headshot Portraits**  
### *By Peter Hurley (2015)*  

Peter Hurley’s *The Headshot* is more than just a photography guide—it’s a masterclass in portraiture, psychology, and expression coaching. As one of the world’s top headshot photographers, Hurley shares his expertise on capturing compelling, natural, and engaging portraits. This expanded summary dives deep into his key concepts, including lighting techniques, camera settings, directing the subject, and the psychological aspects of bringing out authentic expressions.  

---

# 📷 **Why Headshots Matter**  
A headshot is a crucial representation of an individual, whether for professional, personal, or artistic purposes. Hurley highlights that:  

✔ **A strong headshot can make a lasting impression**—it’s often the first image people see on LinkedIn, corporate websites, or casting profiles.  
✔ **Expression is the key to connection**—a genuine, confident, and approachable look will draw people in.  
✔ **A well-crafted headshot can elevate a personal brand**—it communicates professionalism, personality, and presence.  

Hurley believes that a photographer’s role is not just technical but psychological—helping subjects feel comfortable and bringing out their most natural, compelling self.  

---

# 🎭 **Mastering Expression: The Heart of a Headshot**  
Unlike traditional portraits, where lighting or styling might dominate, Hurley argues that the *subject’s expression* is the most critical aspect of a headshot.  

## **1️⃣ The Squinch** – Hurley’s Signature Technique  
Hurley introduced the concept of the **"squinch"**—a subtle narrowing of the eyes to create a more intense, confident gaze.  

🔹 Why it works: Wide-open eyes often convey fear or uncertainty, while slightly squinted eyes give off confidence.  
🔹 How to do it: Have the subject relax their upper eyelids and bring up the lower lids slightly—this creates a natural, engaging look.  

## **2️⃣ Jawline Definition** – The Secret to a Sculpted Face  
A well-defined jawline can significantly improve how a headshot looks. Hurley teaches:  

🔹 **Forward movement**: Pushing the forehead slightly forward and tilting the chin down sharpens the jawline.  
🔹 **Neck tension reduction**: Avoiding tension in the neck makes the pose look more natural.  

## **3️⃣ Micro-Expression Coaching** – The Power of Subtlety  
Small adjustments in facial expression make a big difference. Hurley guides subjects with cues like:  

✅ "Give me a hint of a smile"—for a natural, rather than forced, expression.  
✅ "Imagine you just won an award"—to bring genuine excitement to the eyes.  
✅ "Relax your lips slightly"—to avoid tight, awkward smiles.  

By using verbal guidance, Hurley helps subjects ease into authentic expressions that feel natural rather than posed.  

---

# 💡 **Lighting for Perfect Headshots**  
Lighting is one of the most crucial aspects of headshot photography. Hurley prefers **soft, even lighting** to create a clean, flattering look.  

## **1️⃣ The Key Lighting Principles**  
✔ **Avoid Harsh Shadows**: Even lighting minimizes imperfections and makes the subject stand out.  
✔ **Use Soft Light**: Softboxes, beauty dishes, or natural light diffusers help create smooth skin tones.  
✔ **Catchlights Matter**: The small reflection of light in the eyes adds life and energy to the portrait.  

## **2️⃣ Hurley’s Preferred Lighting Setups**  
### 📌 **Clamshell Lighting** (Soft & Even)  
✔ Uses two soft light sources—one above and one below.  
✔ Creates a flattering, natural look with minimal shadows.  

### 📌 **Rembrandt Lighting** (Adds Depth)  
✔ One primary light positioned at an angle to create a triangle of light on one side of the face.  
✔ Adds a sense of depth and character to the image.  

### 📌 **Natural Light Techniques**  
✔ Uses window light or outdoor settings to create soft, organic-looking headshots.  
✔ Reflectors can help bounce light back onto the subject’s face.  

Hurley believes lighting should never overpower the subject—it should serve as a tool to highlight their best features.  

---

# 🗣 **Directing and Coaching the Subject**  
Even with the best lighting and equipment, a great headshot depends on how well the subject is directed. Hurley emphasizes the photographer’s role as a **coach** rather than just a camera operator.  

## **1️⃣ Engaging the Subject**  
📌 **Talk Constantly** – Silence makes subjects uncomfortable. Keep a steady flow of lighthearted conversation.  
📌 **Encourage Movement** – Have subjects subtly shift their head positions to find their best angles.  
📌 **Use Humor** – Light jokes or fun prompts help relax facial tension.  

## **2️⃣ Adjusting Posture for a Stronger Look**  
✔ **Slight Chin Tilt Downward**: Prevents a double-chin effect and sharpens the jawline.  
✔ **Relax the Shoulders**: Helps avoid a stiff or awkward pose.  
✔ **Subtle Forward Lean**: Engages the subject with the camera more effectively.  

---

# 📏 **Composition & Framing for Impact**  
### **1️⃣ The Power of Cropping**  
- Tight crops keep the **focus on the eyes** and remove distractions.  
- A slight asymmetry in framing makes the shot more dynamic.  

### **2️⃣ Eye Positioning & Balance**  
- Placing the **eyes in the upper third of the frame** creates a strong composition.  
- Tilting the head slightly adds engagement without feeling unnatural.  

---

# 🖥 **Retouching & Post-Processing**  
Retouching should be **subtle and natural**—not overly airbrushed.  

✔ **Remove distractions, not features**—Avoid making the skin look plastic.  
✔ **Enhance natural beauty**—Brighten eyes, refine jawlines, but keep the subject looking like themselves.  
✔ **Color Correction**—Adjust tones for a natural, professional finish.  

---

# 🎯 **Camera Gear & Settings**  
Hurley believes that while skill is more important than gear, the right tools do make a difference.  

✔ **Camera**: Full-frame DSLRs or mirrorless cameras with high resolution.  
✔ **Lenses**: **85mm to 135mm** prime lenses create flattering perspectives.  
✔ **Aperture**: **F/4 to f/8** for sharp focus with a slightly blurred background.  
✔ **Shutter Speed**: **1/125s or higher** to avoid motion blur.  
✔ **ISO**: Keep as **low as possible** to maintain quality.
