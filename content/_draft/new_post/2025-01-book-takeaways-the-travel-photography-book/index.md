📏 **Composition is king**: Applying the rule of thirds, leading lines, and framing techniques can significantly improve the quality of travel photos.  

🌞 **Master lighting**: Natural light is your best friend, but knowing how to use reflectors, flash, and exposure compensation helps in challenging situations.

📱 **Use your smartphone wisely**: Today’s smartphones can take stunning images; learning manual controls and using apps for editing can enhance results.  

💻 **Post-processing is essential**: Editing with software like Lightroom or Photoshop helps bring out the best in your images, but subtlety is key.
